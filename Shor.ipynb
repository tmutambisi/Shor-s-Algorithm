    "#### Two problems coming from the quantum theory\n",
    "- Measurement: the state of a q-qubit quantum register is described by a vector of dimension 2^q, exponentially larger than the dimension of the vector required to describe q classical bits. However, there is a catch: in a classical computer we can simply read the state of the bits, whereas in a quantum computer we do not have direct, unrestricted access to the quantum state. Information on the quantum state are obtained by applying a measurement gate, after which the original quantum state is no longer available, since it collapses to a linear combination of only those basis states that are consistent with the outcome of the measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No cloning theorem: since measurement destroys the quantum state, it is natural to look for a way to create a copy of a quantum state, so that we can apply a measurement gate on it, leaving the original state untouched. Unfortunately, cloning is impossible. This is due to the fact that gates are unitary matrix [proof].\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/flowchart.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm consists of two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) [CLASSICAL PART]** A reduction, which can be done on a classical computer, of the factoring problem to the problem of order-finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) [QUANTUM PART]** A quantum algorithm to solve the order-finding problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Shor's algorithm hinges on a result from number theory. This result is:\n",
    "\n",
    "*The function $ \\mathcal {F}$(a) = x^a mod n is a periodic function, where x is an integer coprime to n. In the context of Shor's algorithm n will be the number we wish to factor. When two numbers are coprime it means that their greatest common divisor is 1.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why this function is of utility in factoring large numbers is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "since $ \\mathcal {F}$(a) is a periodic function, it has some period r. We know that $x^0 \\ mod \\ n = 1$, so $x^r \\ mod \\ n = 1$, and $x^{2r} \\ mod \\ n = 1$, and so on since the function is periodic.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "(x^{r/2}-1)(x^{r/2}+1) \\equiv 0 \\mod n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the product $(x^{r/2} -1)(x^{r/2} + 1)$ is an integer multiple of n, the number to be factored. So long as $x^{r/2}$ is not equal to $ \\pm 1$, then at least one of $(x^{r/2} - 1)$ or $(x^{r/2} + 1)$ must have a nontrivial factor in common with n. So by computing $gcd(x^{r/2} - 1, n)$, and $gcd(x^{r/2} + 1, n)$, we will obtain a factor of n, where gcd is the greatest common denominator function.\n",

    "${8^2 - 1 \\equiv 0 \\ (mod \\ 21)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "21 divides (8+1)(8-1), but does not divide neither of these. However 21 = 3 x 7 and as we can see 3 divides (8+1) and 7 divides (8-1).<br>\n",
    "So we can recover the prime factors by computing $gcd(21, 8+1) = 3$ and $gcd(21, 8-1) = 7$\n",

    "and if we are lucky ${\\implies}$ r is even, so we can write ${(x^{r/2})^2 \\equiv 1 \\ (mod \\ N)}$<br>\n",
    "and if we are even luckier ${\\implies x^{r/2} \\not \\equiv \\pm 1 \\ (mod \\ N)}$ \n",

    "Lucky is a bit too general...Fortunately there's a lemma which says the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemma:** *Let N be an odd composite, with at least two distinct prime factors, and let x be uniformly random between 0 and N-1. if GCD(x, N) = 1, then with probability at least 1/2, the order r of x (mod N) is even, and x^r/2 is a nontrivial square root of 1 (mod N).*\n",
    "\n",
    "But why is this good for a quantum algorithm?<br>\n",
    "The problem is that the number of steps after which the sequence starts repeating itself could be almost as large as n (in RSA n is a very big number!)\n",

    "The quantum Fourier transform (for short: QFT) is a linear transformation on quantum bits, and is the quantum analogue of the discrete Fourier transform. \n",

    "Like the classical Fourier transform, quantum Fourier transform (QFT) takes data from the original signal representation to the frequency domain representation. The QFT differs from the classical Fourier transform in that it operates on a superposition state and produces a different superposition state as the output.\n",

    "The quantum Fourier transform can be performed efficiently on a quantum computer, with a particular decomposition into a product of simpler unitary matrices. Using a simple decomposition, the discrete Fourier transform on ${\\displaystyle 2^{n}}$ amplitudes can be implemented as a quantum circuit consisting of only ${\\displaystyle O(n^{2})}$ Hadamard gates and controlled phase shift gates, where ${\\displaystyle n}$ is the number of qubits. This can be compared with the classical discrete Fourier transform, which takes ${\\displaystyle O(n2^{n})}$ gates (where ${\\displaystyle n}$ is the number of bits), which is exponentially more than ${\\displaystyle O(n^{2})}$. However, the quantum Fourier transform acts on a quantum state, whereas the classical Fourier transform acts on a vector, so not every task that uses the classical Fourier transform can take advantage of this exponential speedup.\n",

    "#### *Modular Exponentiation*\n",
    "The bottleneck in the quantum factoring algorithm is modular exponentiation. The modular exponentiation problem, given n, x and r, find ${x^r \\ (mod \\ n)}$. Fundamentally, quantum modular exponentiation is ${O(n^3)}$; this means that the number of quantum gates or operations scales with the cube of the length in bits of the number to be factored. It consists in *2n* modular multiplications, each of which consists of ${O(n)}$ additions, each of which requires ${O(n)}$ operations. However, ${O(n^3)}$ operations do not necessarily require ${O(n^3)}$ time steps. On an abstract machine, it is relatively straightforward to see how to reduce each of those three layers to ${O(log n)}$ time steps, in exchange for more space and more total gates, giving a total running time of ${O(log^3 n)}$ if ${O(n^3)}$ qubits are available and an arbitrary number of gates can be executed concurrently on separate qubits. Such large numbers of qubits are not expected to be practical for the foreseeable future, that is why some people are trying to optimize this process (see [this paper for more info](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/0408006.pdf)).\n",

    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) it replaces a QFT acting on M qubits with a semiclassical QFT acting repeatedly on a single qubit. This because \"[...] the Fourier transform preceding the final measurement in Shor's algorithm for factorization on a quantum computer can be carried out in a semiclassical way by using the “classical” (macroscopic) signal resulting from measuring one bit to determine the type of measurement carried out on the next bit, and so forth. In this way all the two-bit gates in the Fourier transform can be replaced by a smaller number of one-bit gates controlled by classical signals.\" (https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.3228)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) the input state is subject to a conditional multiplication based on the most significant bit k of the period register. At most, there will be two results after this first step. It follows that, for the very first step, it is sufficient to implement an optimized operation that conditionally maps ${|1\\rangle \\rightarrow |a^{{2^{k}}} mod N \\rangle}$. Considering the importance of a high-fidelity multiplication (with its performance being feed forwarded to all subsequent qubits), this efficient simplification improves the overall performance of experimental realizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "And other optimizations...\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth to underline that Kitaev’s approach requires in-sequence measurements, qubit recycling to reset the measured qubit, feed-forward behavior of gate settings on the basis of previous measurement results, and controlled quantum operations-tasks **that have not been realized in a combined experiment to date**."
